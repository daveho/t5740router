title: "HP t5740 Home Router"
---

TL;DR I am working on setting up an HP t5740 thin client to serve as a home router, using Debian 8 (Jessie).  This is very much a work in progress!  I will be updating this website as the project progresses.

## News

* **April 15th, 2016** &mdash; Hard drive is installed, and the system is running Debian.  Next step is setting up [Shorewall](http://shorewall.net/).

## Background

For a long time I have been using an [ASUS RT-N16](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/RTN16/) router running [Tomato USB](http://tomatousb.org/) for my home network.  In addition to serving as a router, it also serves as a light-duty NAS using a USB hard drive.  (I know that in principle the router and NAS should be separate devices, but whatever, it works for us.)  In general, this setup has worked extremely well.

*However*...there is one thing that I find problematic about home routers, which is that you are dependent on either the device vendor or the maintainers of the OSS firmware to provide timely updates.  Neither vendors nor firmware maintainers have a great track record of providing updates.  Tomato USB, for example, isn't even maintained at this point.  I will speculate that part of the reason for this is the limited hardware (RAM, CPU, and flash storage) in home routers, which makes wholesale replacement of the entire firmware image the only practical update mechanism.  Contrast this with a full OS such as [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), where incremental updates are provided for all software on a regular basis.  I want to be able to do

    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

on my router!
