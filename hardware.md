This is the hardware I used:

> Item | Cost | Where purchased
> ---- | ---- | ---------------
> HP t5740, 2 GB RAM, 2 GB flash | $25 | Ebay
> HP t5740 PCI expansion chassis | $15 | Amazon (search for "hp t5740 pci")
> HP NC360T PCIe dual gigabit ethernet | $16 | Ebay
> 2 x 2GB DDR3 SODIMMs | $12 | Ebay
> [Right-angle SATA adapter](http://www.microsatacables.com/sata-22-pin-male-to-22-pin-female-right-angle-adapter) | $5.25 | <http://www.microsatacables.com/>
> [SATA M/F extension cable](http://www.microsatacables.com/22-pin-sata-male-to-female-extension-cable-5v-12v) | $3.75 | <http://www.microsatacables.com/>
> 2.5" Seagate 320GB SATA drive | n/a | Left over from laptop
> Small nylon washers | $1 | Lowes
> 20 x 10mm M3 screws | $5 | Ebay

Expenses were comfortably less than $100, although I will need to get a wireless access point and an ethernet switch to complete the setup.

I have seen the HP NC360T dual ethernet card on Amazon for around $10.  As far as I can tell, it's just a rebadged Intel dual port gigabit card: Dell and probably other PC vendors have their own variants.  Anything based on the Intel 82571EB or similar chipsets should be a good option.  Make sure you get a card with a full height bracket (not a low profile bracket.)  You could potentially just use a card with a single port, since the t5740 does have one built-in (Broadcom) ethernet adapter already.

Note that only 3 M3 screws are needed.  If you can find slightly shorter screws (perhaps 8 or 9 mm), that could be desirable (the 10mm screws were just a *bit* on the long side in my installation).  Also, the nylon washers should be relatively thin: they are used as spacers for installing the hard drive, and the clearance is somewhat tight.

If you can find a thin (7mm) SATA hard drive, that is also desirable (again, because of space issues).  The one I used was left over from my Lenovo T430 laptop following an upgrade to an SSD.
