title: "Thin clients"

Thin clients are a nice option for use as a home router:

* They're cheap, since they're purchased in large numbers by enterprise users, and when they reach obsolescence they are dumped onto the surplus market
* They're often fanless and consume relatively little power
* Modern thin clients usually use a standard PC architecture, so installing Linux or BSD is straightforward

There are a couple of drawbacks to thin clients for use as a router:

* They typically have a flash Disk On Module (DOM) with limited capacity and limited endurance for data writes
* They only have one ethernet port (a router will require at least 2)

But don't worry, we can deal with both of these problems!

If you're interested in thin clients, the [Parky Towers Thin Client Website](http://www.parkytowers.me.uk/thin/) is a fantastic reference.

After a bit of research, I decided that the [HP t5740](http://www.parkytowers.me.uk/thin/hp/t5740/) thin client would fit my needs:

* It has an Intel Atom CPU, and is reasonably energy-efficient
* There is an optional expansion chassis permitting installation of one standard PCIe card (for adding more ethernet ports)
* The motherboard has a SATA port, permitting (with some effort) installation of a hard drive
